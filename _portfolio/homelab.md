The inital goal of my homelab was to self-host terabytes of family pictures and videos collected over the last few decades, but has grown into a file-backup NAS, home automation system, media library, and more!

The primary server is the ZimaBlade 7700 (NAS Kit) running Debian with Docker containers for most applications.

See more on my GitHub: [austindriggs/homelab](https://github.com/austindriggs/homelab). This has become my biggest and most successful personal project!
