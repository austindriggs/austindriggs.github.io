While in undergrad at WVU, I worked part time at [4D Tech Solutions](https://4dtechsolutions.com) as an Electronics Engineer designing, assembling, and testing printed circuit boards (PCBs) in [RedTail LiDAR](https://redtaillidar.com) systems.

Some of my responsibilities included:
- Assemble and test hundreds of both prototype and production PCBs.
- Adapt test setups for rapid development and prototyping, improving accuracy and efficiency.
- Develop test boards and write automated testing scripts/procedures for production PCBs.
- Created documentation for all LiDAR PCBsâ€™ designs, calculations, and change logs.

Throughout my time at 4D Tech, our major goal was to develop the next generation LiDAR system, the [RTL-450 Recon](https://www.redtaillidar.com/insights/redtail-lidar-exhibits-at-sof-week-2025-and-xponential-2025).
