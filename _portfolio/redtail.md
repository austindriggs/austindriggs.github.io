While in undergrad at WVU, I worked part time at [4D Tech Solutions](https://4dtechsolutions.com) as an Electronics Engineer designing, assembling, and testing printed circuit boards (PCBs) in [RedTail LiDAR](https://redtaillidar.com) systems.

> While I cannot publically display the PCBs I designed at 4D, I designed the [Payload PCB for Univeristy Rover Challenge (URC)](https://austindriggs.github.io/portfolio/urc/) for my capstone my senior year at WVU, where I applied the same design principles and practices that I learned during my time at 4D.


## WHAT IS LIDAR?

LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), similar to RADAR and SONAR, uses laser pulses to measure distances with high precision, creating detailed 3D point clouds of the environment. It’s used in a variety of applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveying, and defense systems.

See the [RedTail LiDAR Applications](https://www.redtaillidar.com/applications) webpage for more info.


## EXPERIENCE

Some of my responsibilities include:
- Responsible for design/development of printed circuit boards (PCBs) in RedTail LiDAR systems.
- Assemble and test hundreds of both prototype and production PCBs.
- Adapt test setups for rapid development and prototyping, improving accuracy and efficiency.
- Develop test boards and write automated testing scripts/procedures for production PCBs.
- Created documentation for all LiDAR PCBs’ designs, calculations, and change logs.


## RTL-450 RECON

Throughout my time at 4D Tech, our primary goal was to develop the next generation LiDAR system, the [RTL-450 Recon](https://www.redtaillidar.com/insights/redtail-lidar-exhibits-at-sof-week-2025-and-xponential-2025). I was responsible for designing roughly half of the circuit boards inside the final system, and contributed to all of them through testing, review, or documentation.
