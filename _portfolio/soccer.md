## ACHIEVEMENTS

Playing soccer at John Glenn High School, I made the All-Ohio team, was a 2-year captain, 4-year letterman, and 4-year Muskingum Valley Scholar Athlete.

My highlights are on my YouTube channel: [Austin Driggs All-Ohio JGHS Soccer Highlights - Class of 2022](https://youtu.be/cfyz4in08KM).



## TRAINING

I individually organized, planned, and ran multiple summer-long trainings for groups of dozens of students in my community to better their technical skills, IQ, and love for the game.
